# Merge conflict resolution

## Setup:
```shell
git checkout merge-conflict && ./setup.sh
```

## Tasks
- Merge branch `merge-conflict` with `merge-explicit` in a way that the story in `story.md` makes sense.
    - **Merge using explicit strategies (with explicit merge commits)**.
- Merge the branch `merge-conflict` with `merge-implicit` with `fast-forward`/`rebase` strategy.
    - With this strategy there mustn't be a explicit merge commit in history.
